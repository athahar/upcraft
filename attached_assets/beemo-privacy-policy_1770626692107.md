**Beemo**
**Last Updated: February 9, 2026**

## Overview

UpCraft LLC ("we", "us", or "our") built Beemo ("the App") as a personal habit tracking application. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

Beemo does not collect or store any personal data. All habit tracking data is stored locally on your device and never leaves it.

We do not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the App.

## Analytics

We use PostHog, a third-party analytics service, to collect anonymized usage data. This helps us understand how the App is used so we can improve it. The information collected may include:

- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- General usage patterns (e.g., screens viewed, features used)
- App launch and session duration
- Country or region (derived from IP address, which is not stored)

This data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally. We do not track individual habits, goals, or any content you enter into the App.

For more information on how PostHog handles data, see their privacy policy at https://posthog.com/privacy.

## No Personal Data

We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other personally identifiable information. We do not sell, share, or rent any data to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.

## Data Storage

Your habit tracking data is stored locally on your device. If you delete the App, your data is deleted with it.

## Children's Privacy

Beemo does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The anonymized analytics data described above does not identify individual users of any age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the App or on our website and are effective when posted.
